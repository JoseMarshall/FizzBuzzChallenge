# FizzBuzzChallenge

#### An application which based on a range of numbers and a bunch of rules, where each rule include a number K and a string S, 
#### prints for each number N in the range the S value corresponding to the K divisible by N 
#### prints N if none K found

#### You can add whatever rules you want, there are 3 methods that allows you to do that:

* addFizzRule(K); 
* addBuzzRule(K); 
* addCustomRule(K, S)
